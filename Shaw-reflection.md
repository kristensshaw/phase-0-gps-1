What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Knowing the terminology and having it make sense with what it does. I am getting the hang of it like: knowing when to clone and when to git push and pul. 
What concepts were clarified during the GPS? Some were, yes. 
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? I asked questions regarding what command in terminal is able to ge the clone in the local repo and what makes better commit messages. 
What still confuses you about Git? I just need to get in the rhythm  of things. I am still trying to grasp what all  the components of github are and how they all play a role since they are not very explanatory. 
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? I struggled a little because i did not know what to expect and how to prepare for it. I am disappointed that I received an average score because it seems like showing that you are not super familiar or struggle with something docks and reduces the points you receive. I am trying to grasp and not let the score bother me since it is there to point out what i need to work on. I also did not have a pair in this session, so I was solo and did not have a chance to refelect ideas against my pair so I felt slightly at a disadvantage, but what can you do. Aside from that, the gps did provide helpful since he did teach me some new shortcuts.
