# phase-0-gps-1
git clone clones  a local copy from a remote repo
cd phase0gps 1 changes me from my current directory to this particular directory
git status helps me confirm where I am in a directory and what I am working on.
touch awesome page.md was used to create a file in this directory with te markdown extension
add awesome page.md adds and stages the new file in the directory before it is committed.
git commit -m commits the new file and allows you to leave  a message describing what was done and to where
git status was to confirm the changes were made
git checkout -b was to create a new branch from the master called add command log
cd readme.md did not do what i wanted
subl readme.md allows me to open this file in sublime
